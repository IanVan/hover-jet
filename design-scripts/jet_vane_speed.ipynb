    "# Jet Vane Speed\n",
    "This document assesses the required speed for the jet vane actuators. My analysis approach is to make a 2-dimensional linear model of the lateral dynamics of the vehicle, and then examine the frequency domain properties of this model to determine the required actuator speed.\n",

    "## Lateral dynamics model\n",
    "The lateral dynamics model captures the vehicle's lateral motion in a 2d-plane. It tracks two elements of the vehicle's pose: the horizontal position $x$ and the pitch-over angle $\\theta$. There is a single control input $\\alpha$, which is the angle of attack of the (two) vane(s) that rotate in this plane. I assume that the jet thrust $F_j$ is fixed.\n",
